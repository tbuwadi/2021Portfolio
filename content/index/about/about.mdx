import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

My name is Tala and I’m in third year at the University of Western Ontario in Canada. I am completing an Honours Specialization in Computer Science and a minor in Software Engineering. I’m currently an Events Director at the <a href="https://wits-uwo.ca/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>Women in Tech Society (WITS)</Underlining></a> where I am helping to make tech accessible for Women in STEM, and a developer on the <a href="https://iveyfintechclub.ca/innovation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>Ivey Fintech Innovation Team</Underlining></a> where I’m helping to develop a full stack webapp for a London Charity called <a href="https://www.cll.on.ca/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>Community Living London</Underlining></a>. This summer, I’ll be a developer intern at <a href="https://jobs.rbc.com/ca/en/amplify" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>RBC Amplify</Underlining></a>, which is an intensive 4 month innovation program at the largest bank in Canada!

In my free time, I make tech content on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tala.exe?" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>TikTok</Underlining></a> to share with my community of over 61k friends. I also like to cook, sew, and crochet – basically anything that allows me to be creative! I love listening to music and some cool people I’ve seen perform live are Demi Lovato, Jason Derulo, Hedley, the Jonas Brothers and Michael Bublé. 

I’m currently seeking 4 to 12 month Fall 2021 internships in PM or software development roles.
